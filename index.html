<h2>PhD Thesis</h2>
<p>The PhD thesis presents a comprehensive methodological approach and quantitative outcomes relevant to the competition's domains, particularly in <strong>Earth Observation and Geo-Information</strong> and <strong>Transversal Competences and Tools</strong>.</p>
<p>The study focuses on the estimation of key biophysical variables such as biomass and crop water needs using a combination of <strong>remote sensing, crop models, and in situ measurements</strong>. The recent availability of high spatial and temporal resolution (HRST) satellite data, such as from <strong>Formosat-2</strong>, has enabled more precise and scalable estimations of crop growth dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Methodological Approach</strong></p>
<p>The methodology consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Estimation of biophysical variables using remote sensing:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>The study utilizes empirical relationships between spectral reflectance indices (such as NDVI) and biophysical parameters (e.g., LAI, FAPAR).</li>
<li>Inversion of radiative transfer models is employed to derive these parameters, addressing issues like atmospheric effects and sensor geometries.</li>
<li>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are applied for the inversion of the <strong>PROSAIL radiative transfer model</strong>, allowing robust and reproducible estimates of vegetation parameters.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Use of Crop Models for Biomass and Water Needs Estimation:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>SAFY model</strong> is employed to estimate biomass, calibrated using time series of <strong>Green Area Index (GAI)</strong> derived from satellite observations.</li>
<li>The SAFY model is coupled with a water balance module (SAFYE) to estimate <strong>crop water requirements</strong>, accounting for evapotranspiration.</li>
<li>The integration of satellite data improves the spatialization of crop models, allowing biomass and water use assessments over large areas.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Validation and Quantitative Outcomes:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Remote sensing data are validated using in situ field experiments conducted from <strong>2006 to 2010 in southwestern France</strong>, covering irrigated (maize, soybean) and non-irrigated (sunflower) crops.</li>
<li>Biomass estimation achieved a <strong>relative error of 29%</strong>, demonstrating a good level of accuracy in capturing crop growth patterns.</li>
<li>The SAFYE model reproduced interannual variations in <strong>crop water consumption</strong>, making it valuable for agricultural water management</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Quantitative Outcomes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biomass Estimation</strong>:</li>
<ul>
<li>The SAFY model showed a strong correlation between simulated and measured dry aboveground biomass (DAM) (r&sup2; = 0.92, RMSE = 0.21 kg.m⁻&sup2;).</li>
<li>Crop-specific accuracy:</li>
<ul>
<li>Silage maize: r&sup2; = 0.96, Relative RMSE = 11%</li>
<li>Grain maize: r&sup2; = 0.86, Relative RMSE = 26%</li>
<li>Sunflower: r&sup2; = 0.78, Relative RMSE = 39%.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Crop Yield Estimation</strong>:</li>
<ul>
<li>Yield estimates derived from the SAFY model were consistent with official French Agricultural Statistics:</li>
<ul>
<li>Maize: 10.1 t/ha (model) vs. 10.2 t/ha (official data)</li>
<li>Sunflower: 2.4 t/ha (model) vs. 2.3 t/ha (official data)</li>
</ul>
<li>The inter-annual variation of sunflower grain yields correlated strongly with reported statistics (r = 0.97).</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Water Requirements and Climate Analysis</strong>:</li>
<ul>
<li>SAFYE estimates showed a relative error of 35% in evapotranspiration prediction.</li>
<li>Driest and hottest years were 2006 and 2009, while the highest precipitation occurred in 2008 (273mm cumulative for the growing season)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS)</h2>
<p>From 2014 to 2017, I led the "Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2" project (HLS, Claverie et al., 2018, RSE), which aims to produce coherent surface reflectance time series from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites. The HLS project was unique and experienced strong growth. Initially developed on a limited number of sites, it provides in version 1.4 data over more than 35 million km2 coverage. As a project manager under the direction of Dr. Masek (NASA), I defined users needs, product specifications, selected and designed relevant algorithms (atmospheric correction, BRDF adjustment, spectral adjustment) through collaboration with research institutes and supervised the data production. Generating such a dataset requires maintaining a high level of quality and consistency over the time; I designed and implemented an evaluation protocol to systematically assess the products. Finally, I directed the related article of the project, which remains highly cited.</p>
<p>The Harmonized <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/landsat">Landsat</a> and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project is a NASA initiative aiming to produce a Virtual Constellation (VC) of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/surface-reflectance">surface reflectance</a> (SR) data acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/landsat-8">Landsat 8</a> and Sentinel-2 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/satellite-remote-sensing">remote sensing satellites</a>, respectively. The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/bidirectional-reflectance">bidirectional reflectance</a> distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30 m MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30 m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35 million km2 and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015. As of 2018, the HLS dataset become global with systematic production over land.</p>
<p>The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/modis">MODIS</a> Collection 6 MCD09CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 L1T and Sentinel-2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90% for the HLS product are 6.2 m and 18.8 m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring.</p>
<h2>Leaf Area Index and FAPAR CDR</h2>
<p>As part of the "AVHRR Climate Data Record" project, I was leading the Biophysical Variables dataset with the task of supervising the process from the design of the algorithm to the production of LAI and FAPAR data from AVHRR data. The database is distributed by NOAA. My responsibilities were: (1) the development and validation of a LAI/FAPAR inversion algorithm (and deliver associated ATBD), (2) the production coordination, and finally (3) meeting the expectations of NOAA, the sponsor. The results yielded a long-term dataset of LAI and FAPAR available online and co-signed with Dr. Vermote (Claverie et al. 2016, Remote Sensing MDPI). This unique dataset delivers daily estimates of LAI and FAPAR at 5km spatial resolution since 1982. The public open-access dataset continues today to serve operational and research applications.</p>
<p>This Climate Data Record (CDR) combines datasets for Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), two biophysical variables that can be used to evaluate vegetation stress, forecast agricultural yields, and other modeling and resource management applications. LAI tracks the one-sided green leaf area per unit of ground surface area, while FAPAR quantifies the solar radiation absorbed by plants within the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectral region. The LAI/FAPAR CDR generates a daily product on a .05&deg; by .05&deg; grid using data derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors from 1981&ndash;2013 and from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors from 2014 to 10 days before the present.</p>
<p>A 30+ Year AVHRR LAI and FAPAR Climate Data Record: Algorithm Description and Validation</p>
<p>In- land surface models, which are used to evaluate the role of vegetation in the context of global climate change and variability, LAI and FAPAR play a key role, specifically with respect to the carbon and water cycles. The AVHRR-based LAI/FAPAR dataset offers daily temporal resolution, an improvement over previous products. This climate data record is based on a carefully calibrated and corrected land surface reflectance dataset to provide a high-quality, consistent time-series suitable for climate studies. It spans from mid-1981 to the present. Further, this operational dataset is available in near real-time allowing use for monitoring purposes. The algorithm relies on artificial neural networks calibrated using the MODIS LAI/FAPAR dataset. Evaluation based on cross-comparison with MODIS products and <em>in situ</em> data show the dataset is consistent and reliable with overall uncertainties of 1.03 and 0.15 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively. However, a clear saturation effect is observed in the broadleaf forest biomes with high LAI (&gt;4.5) and FAPAR (&gt;0.8) values.</p>
